1. Intro                                        *vim-qunit-special-blend-intro*

Ever want to run a single qunit test from your test suite with karma?
Yeah, so did I.

This plugin was created to leverage the functionality provided by the
`quint-special-blend` npm package to run QUnit tests from within Vim. With this
plugin you will be able to run all of your tests, a single test module, and
even an individual test.

2. Requirements                          *vim-qunit-special-blend-requirements*

This plugin assumes that you are running your JavaScript tests with karma.
You will need to `npm install qunit-special-blend`. Then in your projects
`karma.conf.js` have the files array configured as follows:

``` javascript
  files: [
    /* The special blend */
    'node_modules/qunit-special-blend/qunit-special-blend.js',
    /* App and test files here */
    'your/app/js/*.js',
    'your/tests/*.js',
    /* Run the special blend */
    'node_modules/qunit-special-blend/run-qunit-special-blend.js'
  ],
```

3. Usage                                        *vim-qunit-special-blend-usage*

The plugin provides three commands:

``` text
  RunAllQunitTests
  RunSingleQunitModule
  RunSingleQunitTest
```

Ensure that your cursor is within a module or test as appropriate for the
desired command that you are trying to run.

4. Custom Settings                    *vim-qunit-special-blend-custom-settings*

The plugin assumes that your JS tests are configured to be run with `grunt
test` from the command line. If this is not the case you can specify the
command that will run your tests with the `special_blend_run` variable in your
`.vimrc` like so:

    let g:special_blend_run='karma start'

" vim: ft=help"
